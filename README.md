# A pywal based Lush Theme for Neovim.

===

# Introduction

This is my first cut at a Lush based theme that utilizes the pywal mechanism
for creating a palette based on a background. It builds a lua Table from the
~/.cache/wal/colors and then uses the awesome Lush based primitives to modify
the colours dynamically.

# Warning

This is also my first lua based anything, your mileage may vary!

# Todo

I am trying to get lightline working, but with an eye to move to lualine
instead.

# More Information

See: http://git.io/lush.nvim for more information on Lush and a helper script
to setup your repo clone.
